# Balrog

(My copy to play around with. Check out https://github.com/emhuff/Balrog for the real up-to-date version.)

This package needs a better README. Stay tuned.

In the meantime:

* The doc/ directory has a PDF file. Lots of documenation is there.
* If you're in DES, you can check out our wiki page: https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/deswlwg/wiki/Balrog.
